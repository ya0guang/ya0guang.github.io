I'm a current PhD student focusing on system security. This blog is mainly for taking notes from papers of top conferences and record the experience of exploring virtual/cyber/real *artifacts*.

I also like photography, lockpicking, board game, DOTA and touhou project!

欢迎来到我的Blog！最近开始用英文来记录自己在磕盐的过程中阅读的专业书籍/顶会论文来弥补我孱弱的记忆力。未来或许会用中文来记录生活和一些hacking的经历和经验。如有大佬愿意和我交流分享一些经验，那我就感激不尽啦！
