H. Nibaldi, 30 November 1979 <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA108831.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PDF</a></li></ul><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>A Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is the totality of access control mechanisms for an operating system.
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>A TCB is a hardware and softwere access control mechunism that
establishes v protection environment to control the sharing of
information in computer systems. A TCB is an implementation of a
reference monitor, as defined in [Anderson 72), that controls when
and how data is accessed.
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Proof that the TCB will indeed enforce the relevant protection
policy can only be provided through a fonrial, methodological
approach to TCB design and verification...
Because the TCB consists of all the security-related mechanisms, proof of its validity implies the remainder of
the system will perform correctly with resWpct to the policy.
</p></blockquote><h3 class="">Reference Monitor</h3><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>a TCB is an implementation cf a reference monitor.

confidence level that can be assigned to the protection mechanisms it provides. </p><p>...two general design goals to follow after
identifying all security relevant operations for inclusion in the
TCB are (a) to exclude from the TCB software any operations not
strictly security-related so that one can focus attention on those
that are, and (b) to make as full use as possible of protection
features available in the hardware.

In the interest of understandable and maintainable protection, a TCB should be as simple as possible consistent with the functions it has to perform.  Thus, the TCB includes hardware, firmware, and software critical to protection and must be designed and implemented such that system elements excluded from it need not be trusted to maintain protection. 
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Trusted Computing Base (TCB) - The totality of protection mechanisms within a computer system – including hardware, firmware, and software – the combination of which is responsible for enforcing a security policy. A TCB consists of one or more components that together enforce a unified security policy over a product or system. The ability of a trusted computing base to correctly enforce a security policy depends solely on the mechanisms within the TCB and on the correct input by system administrative personnel of parameters (e.g., a user's clearance) related to the security policy.
</p></blockquote><p>Now the concept of TCB is applicable not only in OS but also embedded systems, and focuses on a security-critical portion of the system, including hardware and software.</p><p>Some system (Class A1) still requires a formal design specification and verification of TCB to ensure high degrees of assurance.</p><h2 class="">Authentication in Distributed Systems: Theory and Practice</h2><ul><li><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/121133.121160" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Paper</a> </li></ul><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Another important concept is the ‘trusted computing base’ or TCB [9], a
small amount of software and hardware that security depends on and that we
distinguish from a much larger amount that can misbehave without affecting
security

Rather, the system should be ‘fail-secure’: if an untrusted component fails, the system may deny access it should have granted, but it won’t grant access it should have denied.

More specifically, the assurances are guaranteed even if all elements outside the TCB misbehave.</p><p>The lower the complexity of the elements in the TCB, the lower is the ability to hide malicious/accidental functionality in the TCB components. Consequently, in the design of any security solution it is necessary to lower the complexity of components in the TCB to the extent feasible.
