! Pros

* Extremely extensive evaluation
* Has (a little) explanation
* Evaluate off-the-shelf and self-trained LLMs
* Parameter Sweeping

! Gadgets

We note that restricting our
evaluation to short, localized patches does not necessarily
harm the validity of our analysis, as prior work has found
that security patches tend to be more localized, have fewer
source code modifications, and tend to affect fewer functions,
compared to non-security bugs
