This paper supports the author's following work, [[graphene(-SGX)|GrapheneSGX]].

! Targeted Interfaces (APIs)

* System Calls
* Proc Filesystem

! Method

* Measured the download and dependency data of packages in Ubuntu 15.04. 
* Statically analyzed what syscalls will be invoked in a package and what path will be accessed by a binary (hardcoded string)

! Measurement

* API Importance: A Metric for Individual APIs
* Weighted Completeness: A System-Wide Metric (combined with #downloads)

! Questions Answered

* Which syscalls are more important than others?
* Which syscalls can be deprecated? (some are rarely used)
* Which syscalls should be supported for compatibility?
