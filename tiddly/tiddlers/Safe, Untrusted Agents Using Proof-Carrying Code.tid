The code and annotations are sent to a parser, which generates IL to be executed in a symbolic evaluator. The symbolic evaluator derives a predicate and asks an untrusted prover to solve it. The proof is encoded in Edinburgh Logical Framework. A type of proof is type checked means proving the right predicate.

! Gadgets

* Invariant annotation is the most important one
* Their security policy: safe read/write; execution time bounded
