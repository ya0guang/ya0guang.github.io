This is an interesting work.

The idea of GPU record and replay combining with TEE can be trace back to 2021 from an arxiv paper: [[Safe and Practical GPU Acceleration in TrustZone|https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03065]]. This should be the arxiv version of the ASPLOS'22 paper [[GPUReplay: a 50-KB GPU stack for client ML|https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3503222.3507754]].
