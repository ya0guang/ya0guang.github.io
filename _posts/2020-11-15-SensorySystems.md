# Sensory Systems

- Input: Energy contains info about the world
1. Accessory structure modifies energy
2. Receptor transduces energy into a neural response
3. Sensory nerves transfer the coded activity to the central nervous sys
4. Thalamus processes and relays the neural response
5. Cerebral cortex receives input abd produces the sensation and perception

## Hearing

![earStructure](https://st4.depositphotos.com/16959514/26971/v/1600/depositphotos_269713596-stock-illustration-human-ear-anatomy-ears-inner.jpg)

Vibration -> air molecules compression -> tympanic membrane transfer vibrate -> incus -> flow of the liquid in cochlea -> hair cell sense different freq of sound

### Auditory System

- cochlea
- auditory nerve
- brainstem
- Thalamus
  - Medial geniculate nucleus
- auditory cortex

## Somatosense

- Touch Receptors
  - Pressure
  - Indentation
  - Vibration
  - Stretch
- Pain receptors (nociception)
  - Pressure
  - Heat
  - Chemical
- Temperature receptors
  - Warm
  - Cold
- Proprioceptive - kinesthesia (body position)
  - Muscle stretch
  - Tendon stretch
  - Joint movement
- Proprioceptive - vestibular (balance)
  - Semi-circular canals (hair cells)

## Smell and Taste

- Flavor: taste + smell
- Olfaction: Chemicals in the air
- Gustation: Chemicals in liquid

### Taste

- Bitter
- Sour
- Salty
- Sweet

### Pathway

- olfactory bulb -> olfactory (piriform) cortex 
- taste buds -> 3 nerves -> thalamus -> insula (primary gustatory cortex)

## Vision

- Two types of cell: Rod (monochrome) and Cone (RGB)
- Fovea: Small cones only
- Periphery: large cones & many rods
