# Lecture 

## 9.1

- intron & exon
- primer design

# DNA and RNA

感觉一节课把我整个高中学过的东西都讲完了。

- DNA strand: a sugar/phosphate backbone; polarity of (5' to 3')
- DNA can be double stranded *ds* or single stranded *ss*, stability
- **"Wastson-Crick" double helical conformation**, A=(2H)=T, C=(3H)=G
- Increase temperature or change pH(>12.5): *ds* -> *ss*
- DNA can be linear (humnan) or circular (bacterial plasmid)
- *ds*: oriented in an antiparallel configuration
- *sense strand*: seq from cDNA (DNA copy of an mRNA)
- Polymerize: dATP => DNA; rATP => RNA
- Synthesis always occurs from 5' to 3': Leading and Lagging (discontinuous) strand. 
- RNA is susceptible to degradation by nucleases
- DNAs & RNAs can be size-separated using gel electrophoresis: negatively charged

## Central Dogma ~~中央教条~~中心法则

- DNA ---(Transcription)--> RNA ---(Translation)--> Protein

| General       | Special       | Unknown           |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| DNA → DNA     | RNA → DNA     | protein → DNA     |
| DNA → RNA     | RNA → RNA     | protein → RNA     |
| RNA → protein | DNA → protein | protein → protein |

# DNA Hybridization

- *ds* DNA can find their matching partners even after cooling from *ss* DNAs
- DNA *"melting"* *ds* -> *ss*
- After cooling down, *ss* DNAs hybridize

## Factors => Melting Temperature $T_m$

- Salt concentration affect melting temp. Higher salt -> higher temp
- GC pair more stable because: G≡C, A=T
- DNA length: longer -> higher temp

## Factors => Hybridization

- Time of half of the molecules to reassociate $t_{1/2}$
- Inversely proportional to the molarity of those molecules
- Also influenced by temp, salt concentration, DNA length
- Optimal temp: ~25°C below the $T_m$
- Short DNAs (oligonucleotides, primers) => larger targets
- Approximate formula: $t_{1/2} = 1 day/[DNA]$, \[DNA\] in *picomolar(PM)*
  
## Applications

- PCR (“polymerase chain reaction”) ~~公主链接~~
- Production of cDNA
- DNA sequencing
- Immobilize nucleic acids
- Hybridization-mediated: RNA interference & CRISPR]

# Cloning DNAs

 - Clone DNA copies from mRNAs <= reverse transcriptase enzyme
 - cDNA was originally to study how each gene product functioned

## Reverse Transcriptase

> Reverse transcriptase is a primer-dependent polymerase that will synthesize DNA from the RNA template.

- Convert DNA into a *ds* DNA
- Analyzing DNAs is easier than RNAs
- DNA oligonucleotides are used to “prime” first strand cDNA synthesis. 
- Using random primers/oligo-d(T) as a primer

## Cloning

The first technique that provided an abundant source of a specific DNA 

![Cloning](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Gene_cloning.svg)

1. Foreign DNA + Cloning vector are cut by the same Restriction Endonucleases
2. They are then Covalently joined by DNA ligase
3. Put the Cloned DNA vector into E.Coli
   
- Most frequently used cloning vector: a small circular double-stranded DNA called a “plasmid”
- Cloning involves inserting a specific DNA fragment into a vector and propagating the recombinant plasmid
- Each bacterium should only contain a single recombinant plasmid 
- DNAs can be cleaved with restriction endonucleases recognizing specific nucleotide sequences and resulting in "sticky ends"
- E.g. EcoR1: GAATTC => G + AATTC & CTTAA + G

### Plasmids

> Plasmids are (small) extrachromosomal circular double-stranded DNAs that replicate independently from the host chromosome (E. coli).

> Plasmids used for cloning contain an origin of replication (“replicon”), selectable marker >(typically antibiotic resistance) and specific sites into which the DNA fragment can be inserted (a “multiple cloning site” or “polylinker”).

- **Selectable markers** typically (but not exclusively) a gene conferring antibiotic resistance. Two examples are ampicillin (“aminopenicillin”) resistance (AmpR) and kanamycin resistance (KanR). 
- **Replicon**: *(Origin of replication and control elements)* This is the region of the plasmid that is required for replication. Many commonly used plasmids have a “pUC” type origin permitting replication in E. Coli.
- **Ampicillin** inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, greatly slowing bacterial growth. The AmpR gene encodes beta-lactamase, an enzyme that cleaves a ring in the structure of ampicillin, thereby inactivating it.
- **Kanamycin** interacts with multiple ribosomal proteins and inhibits protein synthesis. The KanR gene encodes an aminophosphotransferase that phosphorylates kanamycin, preventing it from binding to the ribosomal proteins.
- **Multiple cloning site** *(MCS or polylinker)* This region contains multiple, adjacent “unique” sites of restriction endonuclease cleavage– providing many ways to introduce our “inserts”.

### Subcloning

- Molecular cloning refers to the insertion of a DNA fragment into a plasmid
- **Subcloning**: to “move” DNAs from one plasmid to another, in order to obtain expression tailored to their needs.

# PCR
Polymerase Chain Reaction 聚合酶链式反应

![PCRWiki](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Polymerase_chain_reaction.svg/1253px-Polymerase_chain_reaction.svg.png)

- Enabling the mass production of DNA without to clone it
- Exponential amplification of DNA, doubling DNA mass with every cycle

## Process

PCR requires: 2 opposing small DNA primers

- Step 1, 2, 3 represents 3 thermal cycles
  
1. Denaturation: separate 2 strands via heating
2. Annealing: reduce temp to permit the hybridization of primers
3. Extension: raise temp to the optimal temp for heat-stable polymerase to synthesis DNA
4. DNA fragments doubled with each cycle

- Hybridization of short DNA => to target/template molecule
- Primers define the boundaries of the amplified region (5' -> 3')
- But we can also add additional nucleotides to the primers (e.g. sticky ends)
- Heat-stable enzyme: Taq(generate sticky ends), Pfu&Q5(don't)
- High Fidelity enzyme? fewer mistakes
- Designing PCR primers: need both upstream/sense and downstream/antisense 
- Can also targeting a specific region (Open reading frame)

# DNA Sequencing

A target of cloning is sequencing.

- Cycle sequencing
- Capillary sequencing

## Development in Bio Technologies

1. Gene cloning
2. DNA sequencing
3. PCR
4. RNA interference
5. DNA sequencing (NG)
6. CRISPR

## Chemical Sequencing

- **Chemical modification** Use different chemical modifications of the DNA that permit the subsequent specific cleavage of these molecules: at G, G/A, T/C, C
- **Different-sized DNAs** Resulted in the generation of a distribution of different-sized DNAs
- **Radioactively labeled** DNAs were “end-labeled” using T4 polynucleotide kinase and a radiolabeled form of ATP (“gamma-32P-ATP”). 

## Sanger/Dideoxy Sequencing

![SangerSeqWiki](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Sanger-sequencing.svg/1920px-Sanger-sequencing.svg.png)

- Dideoxynucleotide(ddNTP): X 3' -OH => termination of growing DNA strand
- In the original format, each tube contained all 4 dNTPs but just one ddNTP
- The chain-termination happened infrequently => a broad rage of sized-DNAs
- All the DNAs are “single-stranded” and all must share 

### Fluorescently Tagged Primers

> The 4 different “colors”, permitted loading the sample onto a single lane.

### "Shotgun" Sequencing

For very long sequences: human, mouse, etc.

- DNA samples is first broken into small pieces
- The data is assembled bioinformatically <= overlapping information

## NG Sequencing

- High Throughput
- Require Imaging
- Detect the release of "pyrophosphate" or "H+"

Technologies

- 454 (Roche) “pyrosequencing”
- Illumina/Solexa sequencing (short seq, color of light)
- Ion semiconductor sequencing (“Ion torrent”), monitoring the release of H+
- Single molecule “real-time” (“SMRT”) sequencing (long seq)
- “Nanopore” sequencing

## Human Genome Project

**There is no ideal human genome reference sequence as we are all different**

- Protein-coding genes: ~20k
- Non-coding genes: encode RNAs are never translated into proteins
- Alternative splicing: a mature mRNA need not include every exon present within a gene => increases the number of proteins can be made from one gene
- Organismal complexity may be related to differences in gene regulation.
- Reference Sequence: Not complete => "NGS" to sequence individuals
- SNP: single nucleotide polymorphisms ~3.5M
- CNV: copy number variants, ~1000 large (>500 bp)
- Genome Projects of different populations and higher coverage

### What Genomics Make Human Human?

- Humans and chimps were ~98.77% identical in shared regions
- FOXP2 had been identified as the gene mutated in a British family having an inherited speech disorder
- FOXP2 plays a role in “vocalization” but it is not the “language” gene separating apes from man
- The human brain is ~3 times larger than that of the chimp
- Overexpression of NOTCH2NL in human neural cortical progenitors in vitro leads to an increase in cell number

### Precision Medicine

- to predict who is at risk
- to diagnose disorders
- permit “personalized” health care 
- permit the rapid diagnosis of pathogens
- ethical questions: privacy & disclosure


## RNA Sequencing

- RNAs are not being directly sequenced but are converted to DNAs using reverse transcriptase
- Single cell RNA seq: Linnarsson lab neural cell profiling
- Cells can be categorized by similarities in their gene expression profiles using RNAseq


# Transgenic & Knockout Mice

- Transgenic mice contain modified DNAs that have “randomly integrated” into the genome
- Knockout mice have been traditionally made by using homologous recombination. 
- The normal allele is modified via replacement with an altered DNA that eliminates the expression of that gene

## Transgenic 

May insert transgenes into ant chromosome.

- The DNA construct used for the production of a typical transgenic mouse contains a promoter, protein-coding region, poly (A) addition site and an intron.
- the inserted DNAs are frequently found in tandem arrays, i.e. there are multiple adjacent copies of each transgene.

## Knockout mice

- Actual recombination occurs in embryonic stem cells (“ES cells”) and not in the fertiilized egg
- "targeting construct": selectable marker()neomycin resistance + associated elements flanked by "homology arms"
- The arms are regions of DNA that permit precise homologous recombination into the normal gene locus.
- The recombination event is designed to eliminate one or more of the gene’s exons.
- A second marker (HSV-tk) is used to select against the random insertion of the construct.
- A few of these cells are injected into early stage pre-implantation embryos (blastocysts)
- It is only useful if the altered gene is “in the germline” 

![Wiki](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Knockout_mouse_production_2.svg/849px-Knockout_mouse_production_2.svg.png)

## Fluorescent Proteins

> GFP fluorescence occurs when aequorin interacts with Ca++, which emits blue light. Some of this is transferred to GFP in a non-radiative manner, which then emits in the green part of the spectrum.

- to “tag” proteins permitted visualizing those proteins in living cells
- Variants: ECFP, EGFP, EYFP, mCherry
- The excitation energy must be higher (shorter wavelength) than that of the emitted light!!!
- BACs(Bacterial artificial chromosomes) provide a source of “promoters”

### Usage 

- One can label specific cell types in an organism, which typically means marking the expression of cells that express a specific promoter
- Protein function may be compromised by the presence of the tag.
- Fluorescent proteins are useful for studying the expression/localization or “co-localization” or proteins
- As a proximity detector between 2 fluorescent protein-tagged molecules. 
- Collect electron microscopy data from each section. 

## Cre-loxP Recombination

Cre recombinase is an enzyme derived from a bacterial virus that mediates recombination when it detects its target sequence (a “loxP” site).  

- Two recombinases: *Cre*(bacteriophage P1) and *Flp*(yeast)
- Cre: recognizes a 34 bp sequence (“loxP”) that contains an inverted repeat
- Recombination requires 2 sites, and each has a direction => *excise* or *flip*
- **Knockout mice** are generated by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells 
- **Conditional knockout mice**: contain exons flanked by loxP sites. When mated to cre-expressing lines, the doubly transgenic offspring should undergo a loss of the flanked exon in the cell types that express cre recombinase. 
- Two lines: *Cre driver* line and *Floxed* line
- lox-STOP-lox cassette (transcriptional stop)
- There are different kinds of “mutant” loxP sites and they do not work with the other loxP sites.
- *"intersectional" strategies*(“binary systems”): limit manipulations to defined sets of cells
- Temporal regulation: steroid inducible cre (“Cre-ERT2”). In the presence of estrogen (or tamoxifen), the fusion protein enters the nucleus=> permits one to regulate the timing of the induction of cre activity.

## Brainbow mice

- The Brainbow mice: express mixtures of fluorescent proteins
- The Brainbow mice express multiple (5 or more) tandem copies of their transgenes => each cell can express a different fluorescent protein from each copy of the transgene
- Goal: understand connections; limited successes in the mammalian brain because of its complexity
- Brainbow version 3: these proteins are farnesylated (a lipid modification), which permits membrane association => detect fine axonal processes

### CLARITY

- The fixed tissues are opaque (perfuses” the tissue to eliminate the blood and to also introduce a fixative to preserve the tissue morphology)
- CLARITY: a brain is perfused with a mixture of acrylamides, formaldehyde and a cross-linking agent => The lipids (which contribute to brain opacity) are removed via electrophoresis => clear for imaging

### 3D “EM” Reconstruction

> Kasthuri et al., 2015, Cell 162:648-661.

- Determine the synaptic connectivity of the mammalian brain.
- Murine brain tissue fixed for electron microscopy is sectioned and transferred onto a moving plastic tape
- The tape is cut and placed onto a silicon support.
- These are inserted into a specially designed electron microscope.
- Adjacent sections need to be connected to form a 3D image of a region of tissue
- Typically only one out of nine axon actually formed a synapse.
