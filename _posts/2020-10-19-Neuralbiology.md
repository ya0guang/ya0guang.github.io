- cortex: 6 layers

## Brain areas definitions

- Brodmann's areas: divide brain into different areas, cytoarchitecture
- Functionality 

## 

- monkey: usually used for experiments 
- single neuron recordings: raster plots

## Somatotopy

- Somatotopy: The brain represents the body in an organized way


# Proprioception and Spinal Reflexes
